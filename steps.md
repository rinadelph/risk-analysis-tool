Key Issues:
JSON Serialization Error:
The primary issue is with handling datetime/Timestamp objects in the market data
This occurs in the analyze_risk_sections function when trying to save the analysis results
The market data contains pandas Timestamp objects that need to be converted to string format
Data Processing Flow:
The filing downloads and text extraction appear to work correctly
The error occurs in the analysis phase when trying to serialize the results
Recommended Fixes:
Add datetime handling:
Modify the JSON serialization:
Update the save_analysis_results function to use the custom handler
Add proper error handling for JSON serialization
Add data validation:
Implement checks for datetime objects before analysis
Convert timestamps to strings earlier in the process
Improve error handling:
Add try-except blocks around JSON operations
Implement graceful failure handling to continue with other companies
The script needs these modifications to handle the datetime serialization properly and continue processing the S&P 500 companies without interruption.
Would you like me to provide specific code changes to fix these issues?
